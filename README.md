# How to replicate the issue

1. Clone the project from github

```Bash
git clone git@github.com:thewebmaster/flexlayout-issue.git
```

2. Once cloned, go to the project directory and run `npm install` and then `npm run` and the project will start and open up your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`

3. Test dragging and dropping `Draggable Conent 1`. You should be able to confirm that the drag and drop is working.

4. But if you open the `Floatable Panel` into a `new window`, you'll see that the drag and drop is not working anymore.
